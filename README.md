# Ecommerse Store Page

## Overview

This project tested my ability to recreate a simple ecommerce shop webpage. The
products' information was received through
https://igames-takehome.s3.amazonaws.com/products.json. The webpage contains
product cards that can be sorted alphabetically, by ratings, or by price. A
user can also filter the results by product category. Product information can
be found by clicking on a product card. All other links/features are for 
display only.

## Reflection

This project was a very entertaining one! I enjoyed the challenge of replicating
a common ecommerce webpage. Some of the features I'm proud of the most
is the compatibility with different resolutions/screen sizes, showing product
information when a product card is clicked, and the overall look of the webpage.

Some of the more challenging things with this project include working with
typescript, organizing the hierarchy of components, and some of the more niche
features. One example of this is handling the star ratings. I had to make custom
star icons to show the appropriate rating of each product. I've also never used 
typescript before but thankfully, it was very similar to JavaScript. In the 
end however, I am happy with my work and I hope you are impressed. 


## Compiling and Using
